Python has five (5) standard Data Types:
	•	Numbers - integers, long, float, complex
	•	String - Single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes
	•	List - Created with square brackets [item, item, item]
	•	Tuple - Created with parenthesis (item, item, item)
	•	Dictionary - Created with braces {key: value, key: value, key: value}

type(3) prints int
Type(3.14) prints float
type(‘hello’) prints str


Certification
Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to offer students an opportunity to obtain a Python Certification from Alta3 Research. This certification should work as proof of basic proficiency with Python. To do so, simply complete the following tasks. Code will be graded on a pass / fail basis within 48 hours of the end of class.
Procedure
	1	Create a public repository on GitHub called alta3research-python-3day-cert
	2	Inside of the public repository should be a script called, alta3research-python3daycert01.py
	3	Be sure to observe best practice. Some things to think about:
	◦	Include a shebang
	◦	Include documentation at the top
	◦	Comment your code so it is clear
	◦	Most scripts should have a main()
	4	It should be clear how to run your code. If there are any special steps or prerequisites, be sure they are explained in within the script and the README.md within your GitHub repository.
	5	Your code should run without error when executed with Python 3.x
	6	When you finish, email to info@alta3.com containing the following:
	◦	Subject: - Alta3 Research Python 3 Day Certification - Grading Request
	◦	In the body be sure to include:
	▪	Name: - What you'd like printed on the certification
	▪	Email: - Email address you used to enroll in the course
	▪	GitHub URL: - The URL of your public GitHub repository containing your work to be graded
	▪	Course Start: - Date your course started on
	▪	Instructor: - Name of your instructor (if you remember)
	▪	
	▪	pylint to check for best practices in your code
